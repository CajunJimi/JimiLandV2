## 2024-12-30 18:25:00 - Fixed Notion Content Fetching Issue

### Description
Resolved the critical issue where blog post pages were showing empty content despite having content in Notion. The problem was that the Notion database structure uses a "Content" property that contains URLs to separate Notion pages where the actual blog content is stored.

### Files Affected
- `scripts/notion-sync.js` - Updated content fetching logic to use content URLs
- `debug-content.js` - Created comprehensive debugging script

### Technical Changes
1. **Updated `convertNotionPageToPost` function:**
   - Added extraction of `content_url` from the "Content" property
   - Updated excerpt to use "Description" field as fallback

2. **Modified content fetching logic:**
   - Extract page ID from the content URL instead of using database entry ID
   - Fetch content blocks from the actual content pages
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### Reason for Change
The original sync script was trying to fetch content blocks from the database entry pages instead of the actual content pages linked in the "Content" property. This resulted in empty pages because database entries don't contain content blocks.

### Outcome
- ‚úÖ "Drones" post: 53 blocks, 3786 characters
- ‚úÖ "Billy and the kids" post: 32 blocks, 1396 characters  
- ‚úÖ "HST - Letter" post: 25 blocks, 7828 characters
- ‚úÖ "DSO - 2024" post: 56 blocks, 1633 characters
- Blog posts now display full rich content from Notion
- Local navigation working correctly
