                    <p>Used AI to summarise multiple reddit posts that contained links. Formatting sucks for my eyes, but whatever. Will be trying to document as much footage/images around these ’UFO’ or ‘Drone’ sightings here as possible. </p>
<p>Part 1: United Kingdom Incidents (November 2024)</p>
<p>•	Location: U.S. military bases in the UK: RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell.</p>
<p>•	Events:</p>
<p>•	Unidentified drones breached highly secure airspaces over several days.</p>
<p>•	Countermeasures such as the Orcus counter-drone system, deployment of 60 British troops, and F-15 fighter jets were ineffective.</p>
<p>•	The drones evaded radar, jamming, and interception—suggesting advanced technology far beyond commercial capabilities.</p>
<p>•	Whistleblower Revelations:</p>
<p>•	Similar incidents occurred earlier, including at Langley AFB.</p>
<p>•	Drones displayed sophisticated maneuvers and a high degree of stealth, with no effective response mechanisms available.</p>
<p>•	Drones would turn on lights near bases, seemingly as a taunt, and none of the deployed equipment could bring them down.</p>
<p>•	Whistleblower testimony is documented in a Daily Mail report.</p>
<p>Part 2: U.S. Drone Incursions (November–December 2024)</p>
<p>•	Initial Reports:</p>
<p>•	Sightings began mid-November in New Jersey (NY Post), rapidly spreading across 36 states.</p>
<p>•	Witnesses described drones as SUV-sized, with bright, pulsating lights or orb-like appearances (The Sun).</p>
<p>•	Governor Murphy of New Jersey stated, “The drones are very sophisticated. The moment you get your eyes on them, they go dark” (NY Post).</p>
<p>•	Technological Anomalies:</p>
<p>•	NJ police investigations revealed the drones have no heat signatures (NewsNation).</p>
<p>•	Reports suggest drones with zero thermal emissions, an unprecedented feat of stealth technology.</p>
<p>•	Notable Locations Breached:</p>
<p>•	Military installations such as Wright-Patterson AFB, Picatinny Arsenal, and Camp Pendleton.</p>
<p>•	Nuclear sites and emergency service airspaces have also been impacted (NJ.com).</p>
<p>•	Key Events:</p>
<p>•	Airports like Logan International faced shutdowns due to drone activity.</p>
<p>•	A Chinese national was arrested for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base.</p>
<p>•	A Coast Guard witnessed a swarm of drones emerging from the ocean (NewsNation).</p>
<p>Part 3: Broader Global Incidents</p>
<p>•	Additional Locations:</p>
<p>•	Rammstein Air Base in Germany reported similar breaches.</p>
<p>•	Nuclear facilities worldwide experienced a massive uptick in drone sightings.</p>
<p>•	Arrests vs. Mystery:</p>
<p>•	Local arrests for reckless drone operations (NY Post) contrast with the lack of accountability for coordinated incursions.</p>
<p>Patterns and Implications</p>
<p>•	Shared Characteristics:</p>
<p>•	Drones are large, brightly lit, and capable of advanced evasive maneuvers.</p>
<p>•	Operate primarily at night and hover near sensitive or secure locations.</p>
<p>•	Unanswered Questions:</p>
<p>•	What entity or entities are responsible?</p>
<p>•	Are these drones conducting surveillance, testing defenses, or posing an active threat?</p>
<p>•	Why has identification or interception proven so difficult?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The scale, sophistication, and global spread of these drone incursions suggest a challenge to existing defense systems and raise critical questions about national and global security. Whether the work of a state actor, private entity, or an unknown force, these incidents demand urgent investigation and effective countermeasures.</p>
