<p>Let’s not mince words. The bin in the office is overflowing with white Monster cans. It’s a despicable sight. A monument to a war you’re losing. A war you don’t even know you’re fighting.
What you’ve done in extreme sports and sport in general is impressive. I love nothing more than watching someone hurl themselves down a staircase in some South American favela that shouldn’t be standing in the first place, and I personally benefitted from Salzburg’s great seasons from 2011–2015, with them beating the Asian handicap I bet on throughout those years. I can confidently say you’re good at what you do.
Yet you’re unaware of the war raging in the technology salaryman space. You’re ceding this goldmine while sponsoring childish games, when your main clientele is the burnt-out salaryman who could be part of a team that changes the world. Have you thought of that? Jarring, isn’t it. You’re letting yourself down.</p>
<p>I have a comprehensive, actionable strategy to not just reclaim this market, but to own it. And in owning it, you might just help push the world in the right direction. Firstly, please send me as much Red Bull as possible without requiring the signature of anyone higher in the hierarchy.
Secondly, imagine what could be done if you created environments and events that empower the next generation of technology creators, the way you’ve empowered athletes in extreme sports. Think of the impact.</p>
