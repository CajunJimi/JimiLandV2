    "description": "There is a real lack a good quality/affordable white T-Shirts available. Nearly across the world. M&S did a good under then name of seamless, which of course is discontinued. The remainder are cheap shit. You can however, get a bath if say a 1000 created in china, with great material to your exact specifications, therefore would need to sell roughly 950 T-Shirts. Got to be least 500 other autists which can’t find a replacement for that M&S item from pre 2020. Been on my mind a while this one.",

Web app that allows user to have a conversation with AI, document the conversation, create action item etc that would emailed to X email. Use-case really came down to, i have shit to do at work this morning, how can i take 15 minutes of my drive and save a few hours at work via discussing priorities/ideas/action plan etc with AI. The back and forth of the conversation was actually solid for early 2025. Will do more detailed post on backend etc. ",
